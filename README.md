Hypothesis: Singapore is a good place to live or work in. 

## Target Users 
Our group decided on a stakeholder group comprised of Singaporean graduates aged 16 to 21, holding either an O Level certificate, Diploma, or both. 

## Purpose
Through this project, we broke down the hypothesis into different factors and unraveled this statement by analyzing its different elements, then united them to produce a complete answer.  
Based on our stakeholderâ€™s interview, we learned that many are unsure of Singapore's suitability as a place to live or work in. While many of them have slight dissatisfaction and unhappiness with their quality of life, they are also satisfied with what they have. Hence, we have created the following visuals in response to our stakeholders' desire for overall affordability of all factors, accessibility to goods and services, subsidies, high-quality services, frequency of services, more and equal opportunities, and smooth transportation.

- Shermaine -->  Healthcare, Design, Merging
